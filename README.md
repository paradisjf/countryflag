# Country Flag

This is a simple Android application showcasing the https://restcountries.com/ REST API.

2 pages are present:
 - Home page: this is the main page where you can see the full list of countries with the name and the flag
 - Detail page: when the user clicks on a country, some information is provided.
 

The source code here can be used at your convenience, as long as the package name is changed. 
The REST API is not mine, so there is no guarantee it will work.
